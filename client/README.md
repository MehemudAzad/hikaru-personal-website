Websites functionality: -The project has a navbar with tags home, About, blogs, Contact and login. This is a website made for one individual.
scroling down the user will see courses/service section. On the service section we are displaying 3 of the courses. Underneath there is a button which takes the user to a route where we are displaying all the courses for the website. Then clicking the view detail we are also taking the user to a signle course page where we display the course detail and in the bottom part we display reviews.

-If the user is logged in he can comment. and if the user is not logged in trying to post comment will take him to the login route. Here we implemented toggle between login and register.

-Once the user is logged in he can see his picture on the top right corner of the website, ,clicking that avatar will display him 3 more routes. Logout, My reviews and add services.

-In the Myreviews route he can find all the comments that he made through out the website. And it will also allow the user to delete and edit the comments. He can also delete the comments from the main service page it self.
